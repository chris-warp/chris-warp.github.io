## Senior User Interface (UI) designer
We are looking for people with a relentless drive to master their craft.

**WEAREREASONABLEPEOPLE** is one of the fastest growing design and development agencies in The Netherlands. Specialized in helping international corporations lead with innovation – we offer an unique approach. Through prototyping, iteration and lean methods, we validate the end-user’s needs in order to scale quickly to market-ready products.

In collaboration with our clients we’ve helped create impact for organizations like: Philips, Port of Rotterdam, Philips Lighting, Allen & Overy, ING, Rabobank and many others.

Our visual designers work closely with our UX and development teams to focus on graphic design, user-interface design, problem solving and optimization. As a Senior Designer, you will be responsible for creating the design strategy, structural framework and agency-quality interfaces for our clients; innovation leaders in the fields of e-health, fintech, smart cities, logistics and transport.

Yes, we need you to be ambitious and creative, but we also need you to understand how to design inside of an agency environment, for large scale clients, where you need to both stay within the lines and blow your clients out of the water. We need you to have the drive to bring your best designs to the table within constraints.

### What we’re looking for:
- You have a true love for Visual Design and an eye for perfection
- You have mastered visual/interface software (Sketch, - Adobe Suite, etc)
- You understand motion design (Flinto, After Effects, etc)
- You understand design trends and how to apply them efficiently
- You have proven work experience designing complex digital products and services
- You play well with our international team and love to share your knowledge
- You have great communication skills and a personality that compliments the talent we already have
- Knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS is a plus
- You have a degree in Visual Design or a similar field
- You don’t mind taking a hit for the team in one of our Nerf-office wars

As a designer at WARP, you will play an integral role in a high-performing, international team. We offer relocation opportunities to the Netherlands and are based in a beautiful space conveniently located next to Rotterdam’s Centraal Station.
